## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

After getting all resources from client and agreeing to the design, I started with HTML for content and structure, CSS for rwd, beautiful color palettes that match company's logo and personal brand & elegant layouts. After that, JS to add some functionality & interaction. 


## Optimizations

Will update new photo carousel with promos and videos of projects, and add an e-shop.
